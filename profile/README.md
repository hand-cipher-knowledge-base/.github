# Introduction
The Hand Cipher Knowledge Base is a free documentation project founded in October 2023 that aims to produce and disseminate educational resources relating to manual cryptographic techniques that do not require the use of a digital computer for encryption or decryption.

A general guide to hand ciphers is currently in progress and will be uploaded in future. Please watch this GitHub organisation for updates.

Although this project primarily focuses on manual cryptography, the usage of digital computers to analyse and/or break hand ciphers is considered to be within scope, as are manual steganographic techniques utilised in conjunction with hand ciphers.

Manually operated mechanical devices such as cipher disks are also considered to be in scope for the purposes of this project.
