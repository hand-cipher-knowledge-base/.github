# Introduction
The Hand Cipher Knowledge Base is a free documentation project founded in October 2023 that aims to produce and disseminate educational resources relating to manual cryptographic techniques that do not require the use of a computer for encryption or decryption.

Although this project primarily focuses on manual cryptography, the usage of computers to analyse and/or break hand ciphers is considered to be within scope, as are manual steganographic techniques utilised in conjunction with hand ciphers.
